        # This creates a single comment and updates it. The "quietest" option.
        # The other valid behaviors are:
        #   delete-and-new - Delete previous comments and create a new one.
        #   hide-and-new - Minimize previous comments and create a new one.
        #   new - Create a new cost estimate comment on every push.
        # See https://www.infracost.io/docs/features/cli_commands/#comment-on-pull-requests for other options.
